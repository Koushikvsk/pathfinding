Pathfinding Algorithms: Dijkstra and A*
This repository contains implementations of popular pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm and A (A-Star) Algorithm*. These algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid, taking into account possible obstacles.

Features
Interactive Interface: You can set custom start and end points for the pathfinding process.
Visualization: The algorithms are visualized in real-time on a grid, showing the exploration of nodes.
Obstacle Support: You can draw walls or obstacles on the grid, and the algorithms will find paths around them.
Multiple Algorithms: Compare the performance of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and A* Algorithm on the same grid.
Algorithms
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. It explores all possible paths, ensuring that the shortest path is always found.

A* Algorithm
A* is an optimized version of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to speed up the process. A* prioritizes nodes that are closer to the goal, making it faster in most cases.
